### Hello there!

Welcome to my homework-04 folder. In this week's homework we go over how to apply reshape data using tidyr and learn about dplyr's joins.

### To complete the peer review, look no farther:
I completed my assignment in 2 parts:
- [Data reshaping using tidyr](https://github.com/angmelanie/STAT545-hw-Ang-Melanie/blob/master/hw-04/homework-04.md)
- [A cheatsheet for joins](https://github.com/angmelanie/STAT545-hw-Ang-Melanie/blob/master/hw-04/homework-04-join-cheatsheet.md)

### Here's what else you'll find in this folder:

1. homework-04_files: all the plots generated by my code
2. homework-04-join-cheatsheet in 3 formats: .Rmd, .html and .md
2. homework-04 file (this contains the tidyr exercise) in 3 formats: .Rmd, .html and .md

Also, this homework was based out of STAT545's [cm009](http://stat545.com/cm009_tidy-data.html) and [cm010](http://stat545.com/cm010_joins-r-programming.html)

### My reflections
I'm finding these skills incredibly useful for my thesis. I was trying to manipulate my data the other when I realized that I could simply implement tidyr::gather to make my life infinitely easier! What originally would take me hours to figure out through google and stack overflowing is now taking no time at all because of the tools
I'm learning from this class. Even if I'm not 100% familiar with how to implement all the functions and utilities of any given package, I'm finding
that simply being aware that such packages and tools exist - is a great starting point! So as I get into the specifics with what I need in my data analysis
I can look up the neccessary info then!
