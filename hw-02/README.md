## Welcome to my hw-02 folder aka STAT545 homework 2 - due 26 Sept 2017

This week we tackle some data frame work including tibble functions (filter, select), piping and ggplot2!

What you will find in this directory:

  + this contains the figures (in .png) generated from my r code
* This README document!
* homework-02 in 3 versions (.Rmd, .html and .md)
