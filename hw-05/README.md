### Hello there!

Welcome to my homework-05 folder. In this week's homework we go over what factors are, how to drop factors and reorder them. Also, more on visualizations via ggplots!

### To complete the peer review, look no farther:
I completed my assignment in an [.md](https://github.com/angmelanie/STAT545-hw-Ang-Melanie/blob/master/hw-05/Homework-05.md) file

### Here's what else you'll find in this folder:

1. homework-05_files: all the plots generated by my code
2. gdp-lifeexp-af-bah-ban-ca.png: this is the final figure generated from the visualization portion of this assignment. Here, I plot GDP per capita over life expectancy for Afghanistan, Bahain, Bangladesh and Cambodia.

### Resources
Also, this homework was based out of STAT545's [cm011](http://stat545.com/cm011_r-programming-file-io.html), [cm012](http://stat545.com/cm012_file-io-factors.html) and [cm-013](http://stat545.com/cm013_ggplot2-continued.html)

### My reflections
I had no idea what factors were until this class. I'm learning more about characters, numbers, integers etc which is proving to be useful for my thesis. I once spent hours trying to find
out why I couldn't integrate two databases for my thesis, only to realize that although both had numeric values, one was a character and one was a numeric.
Another case, I had values "20" but didn't realize in importing my csv file there was a space which made the value actually "20 " and a character
instead of a value. All lessons I wished I had learned through this class before I spent hours struggling in R. Guess its a learning process. See you in STAT 547!
