STAT545 homework 1 assignment

## Hi STAT545!

My name is **Melanie Ang** and I'm a masters student studying fish!

More specifically, I study the impacts of climate change on fish distributions and fisheries in the Pacific Ocean.

## Here are some fun facts about me:

- I love diving
- My favourite food is sushi
- I am a CEO of <a href="http://www.sanddollarenterprises.com">Sand Dollar Enterprises</a>

## Report on my progress:

- For the README file:
    + the first line: I edited in browser
    + the rest of the text: I pulled, edited locally, save, commit, push to github.com 
- For the gapminder R Markdown file:
    + I edited the changes in RStudio and commit, pull and pushed
    
Overall, a great first 2 weeks of class! I've been using RStudio and R scripts previously but not R Markdown. I'm liking the functions of it being able to save my analysis not just the code. Learning about cool resources and programs which I hope to implement in my research!
